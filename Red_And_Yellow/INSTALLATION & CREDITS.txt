How to download:
- Have a Steam copy of Undertale
- Use the Deltapatcher program provided to patch the "data.win" file in your Undertale folder. If this is your first time downloading the mod, use the "Undertalev1.08 to UTRYv2.1.0" patch. If you have a previous version of UTRY installed, use "UTRYv2.0.2 to UTRYv2.1.0"
- When you open "DeltaPatcher.exe" you'll see two slots: "Original file" and "XDelta patch". On "Original file", you should select the data.win file from your Undertale folder. On "XDelta patch", you should select the .xdelta file that is included in the mod's zip folder. Then, you simply click "Apply patch".
- Copy ALL files within the .zip file to the Undertale folder (Steam\steamapps\common\Undertale). Choose to replace files if asked.
- Delete steam_api.dll
If you find any bugs/glitches, please let me know.
- Have fun!
